## Notes

* p2p/discover <--- use this
* p2p/discv5 <----------- OLD, don't use

* [Specification of the wire protocol](https://github.com/ethereum/devp2p/blob/master/discv5/discv5-wire.md#findnode-request-0x03) - for find node, we don't reveal the node you're looking for. This is to avoid malicious peers to generate the node being looked for on the fly and responding with this fake identity. 

* If we have parallel lookups we need to make sure that the paths are disjoin.
